      title: 'Sola Scriptura',
      subtitle: 'Scripture Alone',
      meaning:
          "\"Sola Scriptura\" (Scripture Alone) is the formal principle of the Protestant Reformation. It asserts that the Bible is the sole infallible rule of faith and practice for the church and the Christian life. It holds that Scripture alone is the divinely inspired and authoritative Word of God, sufficient for all matters of Christian doctrine and life, and is perspicuous (clear) in its essential teachings. This means that traditions, councils, or human reason, while potentially helpful, do not hold the same authoritative weight as the Bible.",

        '2 Timothy 3:16-17 (All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness...)',

        'Isaiah 8:20 (To the Law and to the Testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, they have no light of dawn.)',
        'Deuteronomy 4:2 (Do not add to what I command you and do not subtract from it, but keep the commands of the Lord your God that I give you.)',

      title: 'Sola Fide',

      subtitle: 'Grace Alone',
      meaning:
          "\"Sola Gratia\" (Grace Alone) states that salvation is entirely by God's unmerited favor and love, not based on any human effort, merit, or inherent goodness. It emphasizes that God's grace is the sole cause of salvation, from initiation to completion. Humanity, being spiritually dead in sin, cannot contribute to its own redemption, making salvation purely a sovereign act of divine grace.",
      scriptures: [
        'Galatians 3:17 "And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect."',

    Sola(
      title: 'Solus Christus',
      subtitle: 'Christ Alone',
      meaning:
          "\"Solus Christus\" (Christ Alone) affirms that salvation is accomplished through Jesus Christ alone. He is the sole mediator between God and humanity, and His atoning sacrifice on the cross is the only means by which sins are forgiven and reconciliation with God is achieved. No other person, prophet, ritual, or institution can provide salvation, nor is there any other name by which we must be saved.",
      scriptures: [
        'Galatians 3:13 "Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:"',

      title: 'Soli Deo Gloria',
      subtitle: 'Glory to God Alone',
      meaning:
          "\"Soli Deo Gloria\" (Glory to God Alone) asserts that all glory, honor, and worship belong to God alone. This principle holds that salvation, and indeed all of creation and every aspect of life, ministry, and worship, exist for God's glory. It stands against any human boast or self-exaltation, ensuring that God receives all credit for His gracious work of salvation and for His sovereign rule over all things.",
      scriptures: [
        'Romans 11:36 (For from him and through him and for him are all things. To him be the glory forever! Amen.)',
